## Experience 
### **Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Careem (Dubai, UAE)**
*March 2023 - Present*  
- Led the development and continuous enhancement of Matching and ETA prediction systems for food and grocery delivery.  
    - Launched priority-based dispatching reducing delivery time for clients by 2% and courier time spent by 2.5%.  
    - Designed the real-time algorithm to identify Fake GPS spoofing, resulting in a 74% reduction in GPS spoofing across the captain fleet and a 93% decrease in affected orders.
    - Designed a Stage Splitter system to address uncertainty during ETA prediction by segmenting delivery trips (driving/walking/idle) by  
  couriers' GPS signals. Improved ETA accuracy by 10% (5-min window) by training similarity-based models tailored to each stage.  
- Led the Courier Operating Model Transformation from a decentralized network to an intra-zone system with stable shifts for couriers.  
    - Built an end-to-end planning system, including zone definition, accurate demand prediction, supply planning, and shift optimization.  
    - The transformation was applied to 35% of the fleet and improved the marketplace balance, resulting in **$1.5M in annual savings**.
